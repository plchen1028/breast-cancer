# cancer_survey Exploratory Data Analysis
The number of patients is large enough, coupled with various variables and parameters, can answer a few questions. 
The question of whether tumor size or which stage of cancer leads to higher mortality rates can be studied and analyzed. 
What is missing in the data is the time span or date the cancers were recorded. Any mention of what medicine or cancer treatments being used 
like chemotherapy do not answer which cure method is suitable for cancer survivor. The most interesting thing about the data is the number of months 
each patient survived with the cancer, so this can be an interesting way to analyze the data from this lens.
